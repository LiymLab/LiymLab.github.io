## Research in the Rege lab is focused on mechanisms of gene regulation.


Gene regulation is achieved using a variety of mechanisms. These include switching genes on and off using transcription factors, histone modifications and long range chromatin interactions that can regulate cell fate. 

We study gene regulation n eukaryotic model systems. We also engineer novel biological tools inspired from nature that regulate genes for use in basic and applied sciences.

### The central aim of our research is to discover the molecular mechanisms that control stem cell behavior. Specifically, we are working to identify factors that control the progression and branch points of stem cell differentiation.
