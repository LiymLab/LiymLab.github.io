## Research in the Rege lab is focused on mechanisms of gene regulation.


Gene regulation is achieved using a variety of mechanisms. These include switching genes on and off using transcription factors, histone modifications and long range chromatin interactions that can regulate cell fate. 

We study gene regulation in eukaryotic model systems. We also engineer novel biological tools inspired from nature that regulate genes for use in basic and applied sciences. 

We address these problems using a combination of interdisciplinary approaches including genetic engineering, optogenetics and synthetic biology.
