Mitochondria are key, for you and me, and I love to mess with them and see. Sometimes theyâ€™re long, sometimes theyâ€™re stout, and sometimes theyâ€™re angry and just kind of shout. Itâ€™s my hope, with my trusty â€˜scope, to map these changes as mitochondria cope. The pictures are gorgeous, and sometimes glorious, and Iâ€™ll continue to take them until Iâ€™m victorious. Give me some time, and you will find, the continued development of my mind. Iâ€™m excited to be here, but Iâ€™ll never show it, but if you talk with me, youâ€™ll most certainly know it.
