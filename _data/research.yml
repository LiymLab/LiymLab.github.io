  description: 'We leverage our expertise in contemporary genome-editing technologies and optogenetics to build tools to better understand transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulation. 
  Such modern molecular tools will shed valueable information about the spatio-temporal aspects of gene regulation and help to determine causality. 
  Others are designed to resolve targeted problem areas of the biotechnological industry.

  description: 'We are passionate about our science directly impacting the society so our undergraduate projects are typically tailored towards addressing locally relevant problems. 
  For example, we designed a enzyme-based approach to clean red Paan (betel-nut mouth freshner) stains that won several accolades at <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Competition/Results">iGEM 2018</a>.

  description: 'Yeast spend a majority of their time in the quiescent stage, which is similar to the G0 resting phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. 
  We apply our foundational knowledge of chromatin biology as well as genomic techniques to investigate how yeast remain viable during quiescence and factors that regulate quiescence entry/ exit. <br>
