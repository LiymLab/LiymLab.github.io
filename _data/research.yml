  description: 'TEST We invent high-throughput molecular tools to study how biology''s central dogma is regulated. We are particularly interested in devising ways to molecularly tag nucleic acids and proteins with unique genomic or proteomic identifiers. We then use these "barcodes"
    to quantify biological phenomena (*e.g.* chromatin accessibility, chromosomal structure, RNA abundance, protein synthesis rates) at the level of single cells and single molecules, using high-throughput sequencing and cutting-edge mass spectrometric techniques.
    Our ultimate goal is to combine these techniques with synthetic, metabolic, and genetic cellular perturbations, to understand how
    protein-nucleic acid interactions, transcriptional dynamics, and translational dynamics vary in the face of diverse cellular inputs, and how these phenomena ultimately encode cellular phenotype.
