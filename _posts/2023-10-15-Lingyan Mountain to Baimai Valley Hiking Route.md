Recently, we embarked on an exhilarating adventure along the Ling Bai Hiking Trail in Suzhou, China. This renowned trail spans approximately 7 kilometers, connecting the picturesque Lingyan Mountain to the serene Baimai Valley. The journey took us through a breathtaking array of landscapes, from rugged mountain terrain to lush green valleys.

Throughout our hike, we were treated to stunning panoramic views, ancient temples, and natural rock formations that are unique to this region. We spent around five hours leisurely trekking, allowing ample time for rest stops and appreciating the beautiful surroundings.
