Just had a delightful and cozy gathering at Prof. Li's home during this sunny summer break! Surrounded by warmth and laughter, we reveled in the joy of camaraderie over a scrumptious lunch meticulously prepared by our talented chef, Yacheng. The flavors were as rich as the conversations shared, making it a day to cherish. It's moments like these that truly define the essence of togetherness!
