Recently, our lab was delighted to host a visit from Prof. Yu Li. We took the opportunity to share our progress and challenges of bioinformatics research. Professor Li, in turn, introduced his own research and provided valuable insights and perspectives that expanded our understanding of the field.

Lunch was a highlight of the visit, serving as a break from our work and providing an opportunity for casual conversation.  We discussed various topics, ranging from research to daily life,  and everyone felt refreshed, inspired, and enriched. Prof. Li's visit was a fruitful and enjoyable experience. It fostered collaborations, expanded our horizons, and left us feeling happy and grateful for the opportunity to learn from such an esteemed scholar. We look forward to future opportunities to continue this exchange of ideas and experiences!
