Today was a truly special day at our lab! Prof. Jingyi Jessica Li joined us for lunch, and we sampled the delicious flavors of Suzhou cuisine. We chatted, laughed, and shared stories and updates about our research. Professor Li's warm personality and engaging stories made the lunch even more enjoyable. After lunch, we invited Prof. Li to visit our lab, and briefly introduced our work environment.

Thank you, Prof. Li, for taking the time to visit us and share your wisdom. Your visit was truly a highlight of our lab's journey, and we are all grateful for the opportunity to learn from you!
