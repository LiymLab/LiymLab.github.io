# Welcome to the Rege Lab!

We are part of the [Department of Microbiology](https://www.ruiacollege.edu/Department/Deptindex.aspx?page=a&ItemID=caeca&nDeptID=ee) in the [Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College](http://www.ruiacollege.edu/).

Research in our laboratory is focused on understanding various aspects of gene regulation.  Our focus areas are genome engineering, synthetic biology and chromatin dynamics. We are especially interested in developing research ideas suitable for resource limited settings.
