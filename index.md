## Welcome to the LYM Lab!

<font size=4> We are part of the Department of Bioinformatics at [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/).  </font>

<font size=4> Our research is focused on transcriptomics and epigenomics. We are particularly interested in using and developing bioinformatic methods to investigate the functions of epigenetic regulation in both basic biological processes and the development of diseases. </font>

<font size=4> Our research directions include: (1) Studying the function of nucleosome-related epigenetic regulations in fundamental biological processes and disease development; (2) Developing non-invasive diagnostic methods for cancer based on cell-free DNA in blood and other body fluids; (3) Evaluation and development of multi-omics data processing and analysis algorithms. </font>
