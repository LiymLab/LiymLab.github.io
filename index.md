# Welcome to the Rege Lab!

We are part of the [Department of Microbiology](https://www.ruiacollege.edu/Department/Deptindex.aspx?page=a&ItemID=caeca&nDeptID=ee) in the [Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College](http://www.ruiacollege.edu/).

Research in our laboratory is focused on understanding various aspects of gene regulation.  Using a combination of genome engineering, synthetic biology and nuclear biology, we explore novel properties of microbes and yeast. We are funded by the INSPIRE Faculty award from the Dept. of Science and Technology, India as well as the Innovative Young Biotechnology Award (IYBA) from the Dept. of Biotechnology, India.
